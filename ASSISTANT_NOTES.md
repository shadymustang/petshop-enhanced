# Assistant Implementation Notes

I added the following files to this Next.js starter project:

- pages/_app.jsx (backed up original if it existed at _app.jsx.bak)
- components/ProductCard.jsx
- components/QuickViewModal.jsx
- components/ImageZoom.jsx
- components/ProductCarousel.jsx
- components/CartItem.jsx
- components/SkeletonCard.jsx
- components/Reviews.jsx
- components/TrustBadges.jsx
- components/Breadcrumbs.jsx
- hooks/useLocalStorage.js
- hooks/useRecentlyViewed.js
- hooks/useWishlist.js
- styles/globals.css (appended modal styles if existed, else created)

**IMPORTANT NEXT STEPS (run locally):**
1. From the project root, run `npm install framer-motion swiper react-modal react-icons localforage` and any other packages you use (next-auth/stripe if you plan to implement subscriptions).
2. Start dev server: `npm run dev`.
3. Test components and wire them into pages (I've added components but did not import them into product pages automatically).
4. Restore original _app from _app.jsx.bak if needed (a backup is present).

If you want, I can now:
- Wire ProductCard into your product listing page.
- Create a compare page and account scaffolding (NextAuth + Stripe).
- Generate a patch/PR or a zip of the modified project (I already prepared a zip below).
